# rps-game

## About
`rps-game` is a simple terminal Rock Paper Scissors game, where the player competes against the computer. You may choose to play as many rounds as you like.

`rps-game` is still in beta, but there is a basic interface, enough to fully play Rock Paper Scissors against various computer "personalities".

## Installation

To install `rps-game`, simply clone this repository to your machine and navigate to the `rps-game` folder created:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/loreandstory/rps-game.git
$ cd rps-game/
```

## Running

You must be `cd`'d into the `rps-game` folder and execute `ruby main.rb` to play:

```
$ cd /path/to/rps-game/
$ ruby main.rb
```

Note that you can exit the game at any time by pressing `Ctrl-c`. Otherwise, you may enter `n` at the end of each round to exit, or enter `y` to play another round.
